## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned

during this project i learnt the power in using min and max height properties in styling using css. it help my qr code image fit in perfectly without trying to manually add figures to make it fi

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
img{
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
    border-radius: 16px;
  }
```


### Continued development

I plan on going on to develop more complex projects from forntend mentor to improve my skills more



### Useful resources

i didn't use and resource for this project as i try to figure out everything on my own even though there is really no harm is looking out for resources to guide me on the process
